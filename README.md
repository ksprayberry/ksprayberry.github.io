        <h2 id="1-post">HTMl Tags</h2>
        <h3>June 28, 2016</h3>
        
        <p class="text">Today, I learned about a couple new tags. These were things like links, tables, and comments. I don't full understand the purpose of comments. They don't do much for the page. I do however understand how you can put a paragraph that you aren't really confident in in the comments, so you can revise it laater.</p>
        
        <h2 id="2-post">Text Properties</h2>
        <h3>June 29, 2016</h3>
        
        <p class="text" id="text-layout">CSS text properties were learned. Such as font families, font styles, font weight, and font height. It was a lot of information, but I believe that I will soon be able to remember everything well enough to make a decent website or even a blog like this one. I was also introduced to <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/http://www.csszengarden.com/"> Garden Zen. </a> It is actually a website in which users can use the html and just modify the css properties. It is really cool to see all of the different things that people can do with just a simple line of general code.</p>
        
        <h2 id="3-post">CSS Layout</h2>
        <h3>June 30, 2016</h3>
        
        <p class="text" id="text-layout">Today, I learned about many CSS properties and functions. I learned about margins, width, height, z-index, and float. All of these things are very useful when creating a beautiful website. I created a greeting card and I believe that it is the best thing I have created so far. Even though it is simple, it is nice. I would feel confident sending that to someone.</p>  
        
        <h2 id="4-post">Drawing with Code</h2>
        <h3> July 15, 2018</h3>
        
        <p class="text" id="text-layout">I have decided to revisit coding as this is my first offical day back from GHP andI feel inspired to create new code and improve on my skills. I have forgotten most of the code I learned in 2016, but I am ready to put in the work to do better. I will learn to code better and maybe I will be as good as a computer software major in the future. I learned how to draw a snowman and I did the "code for an hour" thingy on Khan Academy and I have thouroughly enjoyed myself. Thank You for coming to my Ted talk. </p>
